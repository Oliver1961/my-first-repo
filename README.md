I enjoy drinking iced black tea, sweetened  with a little bit of cane sugar, in the afternoon.
This afternoon is no exception.

Were it not for this assignment, I would still be at work.

There's always something new to learn, and one should not overlook the fact that everyone has something to contribute.
